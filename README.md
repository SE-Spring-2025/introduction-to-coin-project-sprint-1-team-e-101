## To Do

**Subteam 1**: John & Thomas  
**Subteam 2**: Jonah & William  

### Sprint 1
- [x] Create a feature branch named Sprint 1
- [ ] Follow the UML in Coin class diagram to code
![CoinGenius](/assets/Coin-V1-Class.png)
- [ ] Document all the steps of your code in the README.md file

### Sprint 2
- [ ] Push your code to the feature branch on github
- [ ] Pull frequently from the github feature branch
- [ ] Peer review the other subteam's code
- [ ] Respond to the other subteam's pull request


## Instructions
Welcome to CoinGenius, your "course-embedded" internship.

You are an intern at CoinGenius LLC. We are an independent contractor for the U.S. Treasury Department. They want to "test drive" some new aspects of their coinage processes from the ground up and have assigned the project to you and some of your fellow interns. Your first assignment is fairly simple. It focuses on laying the groundwork for the system and getting comfortable working in your team.

- [x] To get started, have one of your group members create a group and accept the assignment here.
Then the other group members should follow that same link but join the group created by the first member.

Your team of 3-4 persons will be broken into two subteams. Subteam 1 will work on the "code" part and subteam 2 will work on the "test" part. When subteam 1 is ready for a peer code review they will do a pull request and someone on subteam 2 must respond. Similarly, subteam 2's pull request is to be managed by someone on subteam 1. We will rotate the subteams on the next sprint.


Workflow
Our team workflow is always to create a "feature branch" first. For our project each feature will be it's own "sprint" (or assignment). Name it Sprint 1
Both subteams will work on this feature branch together. This means there are likely to be many "conflicts" as other people are adding code (commits) to the branch.
You should frequently push your code to the feature branch on github so the other team gets those intermediate bits and bytes. Let's just agree to only push code that compiles; but it doesn't have to be completely finished yet.
Because others are pushing frequently, you should correspondingly be "pulling" frequently from the github feature branch. In fact, we'll make it a "rule" that before you push you should pull.
Direction: Follow the UML in Coin class diagram to  code.

Use the read me file. Document all the steps of your code.
